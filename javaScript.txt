Try to understand callbacks as it is very confusing to me:

Okay let us take a most basic example from web designing:
var server = http.createServer(function(request , response){
                var filePath = false;
                if(request.url == '/'){
				filePath = "public/index.html";
				}
				else{
				  filePath = "public" + request.url;
				}
                var absPath = "./" + filePath;
				serveStatic(response , cache , abspath);
             })
			 
			 
Now, we can see that http.createServer is a function which
takes a callback function as a parameter.

var http = new Object();
http.createServer = function(callback){
                 
                # Do the stuff of creating server 
				# We will have a request and a response with us. 
				# Suppose they are called req and res.  
				callback(req,res);
				# We call the callback function here and so it will 
				# be implemented from here only.
}			 
When user types in the url of the website , a request will
be generated from the browser(client) to the server to send the static files
to populate the site. Server will check the address of the request url and 
send the webpages associated with that page.
